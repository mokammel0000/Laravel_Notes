The easiest way to validate a request, is to validate the request data that is send, 
    $request->validate([
            'name'=>'required',
            'phone'=>'required',
            'photo'=>'required| mimes:jpg,bmp,png',
            
            'email'=>'required',
            'password'=>'required|confirmed',
    ]);
    take care that the $request variable will hold the data that pass from validation process...
    
Write Validation Rules BEFORE any thig in the controller, 
    to validate the sending data, before doing any action, 
    if the sending data isn't right, redirect to the form with the error messeges.


Validation Rules: 
    if there are two or three: u can seperate them using PIPE LINE |
    if there art more than three: put them in an [array], to make them easier in reading.


In the UNIQUE attribute: 
    if the name of the field as same as the name of the coloumn in the table in DB.
    you don't have to write the coloumn name.
