ORM:
    DML for the DB in Laravel.
    stands for: Object Relational Mapper.
    a design pattern, each framework give it a special name, 
        laravel named it: [Eloquent ORM].

ORM is a DML that can Select/ Insert/ Update/ Delete/ data from DB,
    Instead of write mysql code, we can use ORM to manipulate with DB using traditional classes and methods.

ORM applys MVC pattern, it deals with DB through MODEL,
    Model is the object that u call to deal with the table from it.

ORM is based on query builder...
    It's better to use ORM than use query builder if u want to make a complex relationships.

Use ORM in the simple queries,
    if u want to write a complex queries(like joins & calculations on Columns),
    ORM will be very complex and low performance way to deal with, 
    then u can use Expressions in the query builder(It enables you to write MYSQL commands).


-Insert

-Update

-Mass Assignment

-Upsert
    you may need to update an existing model or create a new model if no matching model exists

-Deleteing/ Destroying

-Soft Deleting
    In addition to actually removing records from your database, Eloquent can also "soft delete" models.
    When models are soft deleted, they are not actually removed from your database. Instead,
    a deleted_at attribute is set on the model indicating the date and time at which the model was "deleted".
