If u enabel users to upload images in your website,
    each one will upload photos with different attributes(size, extension, quality)

    Then if u want to show these photos in your page,
    you will find it misrable (each photo will be shown in a some way that's differ from others).

you can leave the front-end developer deal with this dilemma, but it's solutions will not be effecient, 
    photo will be pixiled, will be cropped from an important part, aspect ratio will be bad, ...etc.


So, it's important to deal with photos in the backend part, before storing it: 
    to do that: 
    u can use some packeges in php or in laravel to facilitate things, the famous packeges are: 


If u write Native php code: [Image proccessing and Generation/ GD and Image Functions]
                            [GD Library and Imagick Library].
            but u will write a bunch of code...


Using Laravel: [Intervention Image], is a php packege,
    You can consider it as a small photo Editor, 
    using it, u can do the following: 
        -check if it's a photo or not, 
        -convert it's type from one to another(for example: .jpg to .png),
        -Reasizing the photo(don't change the aspect ratio Otherwise it will be a bad photo), 
            package can help u keep the photo with the same aspect ratio.
        -write on the photo, 
        -blur some parts of it, 
        -rotate it, 
        -adding Filters, 
        -Crop some parts.
