In php projects:
    u create your DB (DDL) in your machine, using any DB scheme application 
        (like: Terminal - PhpMYAdimn - MySqlWorkpench - DBeaber), 
    what if u want to share this DB scheme with your team members? 
        -in this case u must send the Scheme to them,
        -then they will export it,
        -they merge it with the scheme in their machine about this project.

    and if u do any change in your scheme, u must send it to them,
    and veca-verse...

    or all of u can work on an online server(shared DB): 
        but what if server has been failed(وقع)??!
        what if u forced to work offline??!
        what if u haven't any mony to pay the host? 



Then using Laravel, u can avoid all these Barriers, using [MIGRATIONS], 
    Write some code, and then send it to all your project-mates, 
    they will run the code, and deal with DB in their own machines.
