Traditional Inserting/ Updating in Laravel: 
    creating object from the Model, and adding data to it [Field by Field], 
    and then save() the new model.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bulk Insert/ Bulk Save/ Mass Assignment: 
    passing an associative array to the model, and it will be saved automatically.
    but note that: input fields thats come frmo html, must be similar to table fields, 
        to enable laravel to put each input in it's right column.
    This way is easier than the Traditional way, but there are a big problem in it: 
        [it is not secure....]
        because of it taking inputs entered from the user,
        and entering it in your DB directly without checking these data....

        so, laravel can't admit u use this way, unless u forced him to make it available for u, 
        to do that write a $fillable array in the model that u want to Insert inputs on it,
        but take care of that: 
            -nullable fields can be written or not, 
            but the notnull fields must be written in the array.

    you can pass $request->all() or make your own array as $inputs to pass it to method(create() or update()).
